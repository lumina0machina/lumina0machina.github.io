<h1>Hello, my name is lumina and i make music</h1> 
<a href="https://github.com/lumina0machina">
<img src="pfp.JPG" alt="profile pic">
</a>
my preferred genres are anything metal related and adjacent, and extreme music in general.
<br>
<b>My current projects are:</b>

<br> 
<br>
<div>
<li><a href="https://kuonbm.bandcamp.com/">Kuon</a> (Crystar Black Metal)</li>
<br>
Kuon is themed around the character from Crystar with the same name, as should be obvious that is also where the project gets it's name from. Titles and (eventual) lyrics too are themed around Kuon, and her dynamic with her sister Rei. 
<br>
Lineup is as follows:
<br>
lumina: Drum Programming, Arrangement, Direction Assistence, Songwriting
<br>
Muramasa: Guitar, Bass, Mixing/Mastering, Songwriting
<br>

<div>
<li><a href="https://rxwxyxoxdxtxyxaxnxlxwxtxcxoxsxa.bandcamp.com/">rememberwhatyouoncedidtoyourselfandnowlivewiththeconsequencesofsaidactions</a> (Crymachina Noisecore)</li>

<br>
rxwxyxoxdxtxyxaxnxlxwxtxcxoxsxa is really just a project where i do random things and see how it turns out. Themes are usually just things i am feeling at the time of making the music, though a rough crymachina flair is usually always somewhere. Due to all this, i am a little ashamed of the project but i have fun with it nontheless so whatever.
<br>
Lineup is as follows:
<br>
lumina: Everything

<div>
<li><a href="https://machina-da.bandcamp.com/album/mechanical-afterlife">machina</a> (Crymachina Dark Ambient)</li>

<br>
